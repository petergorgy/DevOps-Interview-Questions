---

### Question 19: The Wall of Confusion

**Companies need to tear down the \_\_\_\_\_ since it causes disunity and disharmony between the development and operations departments, instead of allowing them to collaborate collectively and align goals or objectives.**

* [ ] Chaos Monkey
* [ ] Andon Cord
* [ ] Status page
* [x] Wall of Confusion

**Explanation**
The **Wall of Confusion** is a metaphor for the communication and collaboration barriers between development and operations. It prevents shared responsibility and hinders progress.

### Question 20: Resolving Dev–Ops Blame Culture

**Suppose your dev team has frequent issues with an ops team in your company. Blame is often tossed around between both groups. How would you solve this issue?**

* [ ] Increase competition between both groups by offering a monetary award for being “the most patient group.”
* [ ] Remove the one individual from each team who is causing the most chaos and assign them training in social skills.
* [ ] Make each group read an article on diverse technology terminologies and have a review session over the article in a separate meeting.
* [x] Embed Ops engineers in your development teams, assign both teams to be in one chat room, and allow them to read each other's source code.

**Explanation**
**Embedding Ops engineers** within development teams fosters collaboration and shared ownership. Open communication channels and visibility into each other's work help break down the Wall of Confusion.

---

### Question 21: Contributing to the Wall of Confusion

---

### Question 25: Central Tenet of Lean

**Let’s say your colleague wants to know more about the central tenet of Lean. How would you explain it to them?**

* [ ] The purpose of Lean is to devalue products according to the amount of “waste” associated with the product.
* [ ] The purpose of Lean is to undertake product development in quick, iterative sprint cycles.
* [ ] The objective of Lean is to focus on the manufacturer’s needs more than on customers’ satisfaction.
* [x] The objective of Lean is to ensure that value streams reach the customer through products and services while eliminating waste.

**Explanation**
Lean emphasizes **delivering value** to the customer by **eliminating waste** and optimizing the entire value stream—from concept to delivery.

---

### Question 26: Effectiveness of Peer Reviews

**Why are peer reviews the most effective means of review for most changes?**

* [ ] They reduce the cost of reviewing changes.
* [ ] They aren't; you should always have a manager review any change.
* [ ] They eliminate the risk of making changes.
* [x] They are performed quickly, in a distributed fashion, by people familiar with the system being changed.

**Explanation**
**Peer reviews** are fast and informed because reviewers are often directly familiar with the codebase and context—making them ideal for most changes.

---

### Question 27: Immutable Deployment Concept

**Certain companies utilize immutable deployment, in which changes to the system are \_\_\_\_\_ as opposed to \_\_\_\_\_.**

* [ ] Updated; replaced
* [ ] Agile; Waterfall
* [x] Replaced; updated
* [ ] Blue; green

**Explanation**
In **immutable deployments**, systems are **replaced** with new versions instead of being **updated** in-place, which reduces configuration drift and improves reliability.

---

### Question 28: Orchestration in Configuration Management

**Why is orchestration an important part of configuration management?**

* [x] Online services require careful sequencing of changes to maintain uptime while upgrading applications.
* [ ] It's not; if you want orchestration you don't fully understand configuration management.
* [ ] To create repeatable provisioning processes that can be checked into source control.
* [ ] It makes releases faster.

**Explanation**
**Orchestration** ensures that **complex dependencies** and **step-by-step execution** happen in the correct order, minimizing downtime and deployment errors.

---

### Question 29: Baking Images vs. Runtime Configuration

**What is the primary reason to bake images instead of performing runtime configuration?**

* [ ] To make configuration management simpler
* [ ] To avoid contributing to the heat death of the universe
* [ ] To remove flexibility from runtime
* [x] To move time and risk up into the development and build cycle and out of the production deployment cycle.

**Explanation**
**Baking images** ensures systems are configured and tested before reaching production, which reduces **deployment-time risk and surprises**.

---

### Question 30: Understanding Containers

**Which of the following explains the concept of containers?**

* [ ] Containers are applications that orchestrate the deployment of virtual systems.
* [ ] Containers are virtualized applications that can be shipped from server to server as needed.
* [ ] Containers are iterative backups that can be rapidly deployed in case of system failure.
* [x] Containers are stand-alone software packages that contain runtime components to function independently.

**Explanation**
**Containers** package applications with all their dependencies, ensuring they **run consistently** across different computing environments.

---

### Question 31: IaC Mindset Challenge

**Suppose you and your project manager are interested in the infrastructure as code approach. What is the chief issue that your team may face when utilizing the infrastructure as code approach?**

* [ ] There are no impediments to employing infrastructure as code in your system.
* [ ] Handling the system as code instead of deploying systems manually.
* [ ] Custom configurations may overwhelm your version control system.
* [x] The mindset and habits of your team members.

**Explanation**
The biggest challenge is **cultural**—teams must adopt a **developer mindset**, treating infrastructure like code with version control, testing, and automation.

---

### Question 32: Benefit of Code-Driven Provisioning Tools

**What is the benefit to a purely code-driven infrastructure provisioning tool?**

* [x] It gives you the most flexibility in what you implement
* [ ] It provides higher reliability than template-based solutions
* [ ] It requires less sophisticated technical skills to implement
* [ ] It is inherently idempotent

**Explanation**
Code-driven tools are **more powerful and flexible**, allowing custom workflows and deep automation—though they often require more skill and effort.

### Question 33: Example of Configuration Drift

**You spin up a system from code, but a week later the hosts file has changed. This is an example of what?**

* [ ] Orchestration
* [ ] Idempotence
* [x] Drift
* [ ] Sabotage

**Explanation**
**Drift** occurs when the live system **deviates** from the desired state defined in code—often due to manual changes or unmanaged updates.

---

### Question 34: Advantages of Infrastructure as Code

**Why is infrastructure as code a better approach than making manual changes?**

* [x] It's more repeatable and testable.
* [ ] Developers are smarter than operations engineers.
