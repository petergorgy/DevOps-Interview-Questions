**Explanation**

DevOps is about **collaboration** between development, operations, QA, and other stakeholders to streamline the software delivery lifecycle and improve overall efficiency and quality.

---

### Question 3: DevOps Principle

**A plan to improve the overall throughput of a service would be best served by which DevOps principle?**

* [x] Systems thinking
* [ ] Culture
* [ ] Feedback loops
* [ ] Continuous experimentation and learning

**Explanation**

**Systems thinking** encourages understanding the software delivery process holisticallyâ€”from development to productionâ€”identifying bottlenecks, interdependencies, and systemic issues.

---

### Question 4: Toolchain Selection

**Tools are chosen daily for many purposes. Which qualities should you look for in a tool before combining it into a toolchain?**

* [x] Creating and maintaining systems using a software development approach instead of a manual worker approach
* [ ] Implementing lean principles in testing and deploying software
* [ ] Incorporating agile and lean product development and management techniques
* [ ] Building reliability into your systems at both an application and infrastructure level

**Explanation**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) involves **managing infrastructure with version-controlled code** rather than manual configuration. It enables reproducibility, testing, and automation.

---

### Question 7: DevOps Understanding

**What are the three levels of DevOps understanding?**

* [ ] Requirements, deployment, and testing
* [ ] Tools, principles, and budget
